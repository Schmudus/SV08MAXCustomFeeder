# Fork
Thanks to Chineko-Koizumi for the great work!
I updated as follows:
Made FILAMENT_LOAD as well as FILAMENT_UNLOAD makro. 
For this it is necessary to have a vetry exact measurement of your bowden tube length including lenght inside feeder and about 20mm inside toolhead.
I uncoupled the bowden tube from toolhead an loaded filament through the feeder with force moves, e.g. <FORCE_MOVE STEPPER="extruder_stepper support_extra_stepper" DISTANCE=100 VELOCITY=40 ACCEL=500>. If the filament is at the end of the bowden tube add 20mm and you have your length. You can use FORCE_MOVE as well with negative values. My bowden tube is 1856mm (it is longer because of different routing).
To avoid very hot buffer stepper motor you can try to change run current. My one is running weith 
run_current: 0.8
hold_current: 0.8
Still enough power and a little cooler. I don`t need the cooling case for it. It is running at a max of 60°C.


# ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION

# Description
Because original external feeder for Sovol SV08 MAX is (being direct) horrible I created this project to adress some issues. I treat this as self-development project so I not guaranteeing that it would work on your setup, but despite this I'm open to sugestions. For now everything is tested only on PLA setup.

# Quick look on setup

I did create my own extender for SV08 MAX so I can use whole 500mm of Z axis but if you do not use extender you need to measure how much height you lose. Not adjusting max height on not extended top may damage your printer!!!

## Tutorial
If you want just bare minimum you have to print custom enclosure for external feeder (in **ABS!!!** other materials would melt). Internal stepper motor gets realy hot and can overheat MCU.
### Hardware needed
* 8x M5 nuts and bolts(40mm)
* 4x threaded insert M3 5mm or 3mm
* 2x M3 bolt 12mm(or longer)
* 4x bearing 608 ZZ 8x22x7mm
* wooden countertop 800mmx400mmx18mm
* 1.5m of any cable capable of transfer power and signal to external feeder

### Step by step
#### Hardware
1) Before printing enclosure for external feeder use "BearingCheck.step" to test if model printed from your printer is a perfect fit, bearing must fit perfectly to ensure smooth filament passage. If not try to adjust offsets until bearings fit and apply them to the CustomFeederCase.step.

2) Print external feeder enclosure in **ABS!!!**. Other materials would soften or worse even melt. Use supports for latches and overhangs.

3) Print every other part in PLA.

4) Those 2 elements might be lose, if so, apply some glue in socket <img width="709" height="461" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/942b7660-bf55-49f1-864d-5afe315b58b7" />

5) Put 4 inserts according to image <img width="1101" height="491" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09866b18-5ee6-4361-a7ef-26ac0b24adc3" />

6) Drill contertop to allow mount of FeederMount.step, TopSpoolMount.step and TopDeckGlassMount.step, the suggested arangment is on photo below, mouting spool on the right shorten the length of PTFE tube. Assembly and mount parts.<img width="4080" height="1884" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c680c8ee-d974-43c3-b17c-4f200b404bdb" /><img width="1194" height="895" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/128d7f71-f5b2-46d5-9856-e67ee444517b" />

7) To hold spool on rollers you can use anything cylindrical strong enough (I used curtain rod xD), but be aware that shaft may shift so aditional stoppers may be needed.

#### Software

1) In mainsail webpage replace original contents of buffer_stepper.cfg with the provided one.
2) Remove references to old buffer macros from Macro.cfg, example how to do it is inside example_Macro.cfg
3) There are 3 things inside buffer_stepper.cfg that may need adjustment:
   * variable_default_rotation_distance: 9.75 (this is rotation_distance in mm for buffer stepper recalculations)
   * variable_filament_length_ptfe: 1300.0 (this is length in mm between toolehad extruder and buffer)
4) Add INIT_CYCLIC_MACROS after CLEAR_PAUSE inside START_PRINT macro
5) Add CENTER_EXTERNAL_FEEDER after INIT_CYCLIC_MACROS
6) Add RESET_VARIABLES_BUFFER_STEPPER at the end of END_PRINT and CANCEL_PRINT macros

# Versions

* V0.3
    * Bug fix for frequent buffor rotation changes
* V0.2
    * New method for centering buffer, centering during print no longer needed

* V0.1
    * Initial macro for resynchronization
    * Initial macro for filament runout detectiom
    * Initial versions of step files for mod
      
Known issues
* V0.3
    * None
* V0.2
    * High flow rates triggers frequent buffor rotation changes
* V0.1
    * If for some reason filament inside buffer slips right after buffer recalculation, it will lead to big change in rotation and possibly constant recalculation those will block printing progress until method SET_BUFFER_DEFAULT_ROTATION_DISTANCE is called.
